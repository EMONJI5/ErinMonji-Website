        <div class="subheading mb-5">A first year at UCR, aspiring to major in psychology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Erin Monji and I am currently a first year at UC Riverside. I graduated from Burbank High School in Los Angeles County, and am very excited to learn and meet new people at this university. As a student here, I plan on switching to majoring in psychology from sociology, as I find more interest in the subject. As of now, I will need to fulfill the requirements for psychology first before declaring a major in psychology. The subject intrigues me more because I took an AP Psychology class in high school, and I instantly really enjoyed the topic and what was covered within the realm of human behavior and the mind. I was able to recognize the patterns between behavior and what happens in the brain to trigger those actions. I hope for a smooth transition between the two majors, and after finishing my degree here at UCR, I want to be some sort of social worker in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Being a premie myself, I hope to support the families who also have to face the uncertainty of their baby’s health condition, as my family did the same for me.

<br><br>

        Education aside, I have played piano since the age of seven, learning beside my teacher who I currently do not take lessons from anymore. Since college began, I haven't had the time to continue practicing as much as I used to, but I hope to keep playing when I am able to. I also played violin in my middle and high school orchestras. I competed with both instruments, but it was individual for piano and in a group for school orchestra. Both competitions were very fun to be in and I learned a lot about musicianship through them. Playing for others was never something I wanted to do as a kid, but over time and after many performances, I do enjoy playing for others. I love spreading classical music when it seems as if not many in my generation appreciate it. Being able to play music and perform has helped my confidence over the years, and, though I really dislike playing at recitals as a kid, I will eternally be grateful for those experiences as it pushed me out of my shell. <br><br>

        As for my personal life, I have two older brothers who also attended UC schools. The eldest brother—five years older than me—graduated from UC Davis as is aspiring to be an optometrist. The other brother—two years older than me—is at UCLA studying biology, and is hoping to become a medical doctor. Through all my years of learning and finding what interests me, my parents and brothers have always supported me. As a student here at UCR, I hope to fulfill what I want to study while being able to also give back to my family. Along with family, I also have very supportive friends who have supported me through my journey thus far, and I try my best to be there for them as well. Most of my closer friends are at different UC’s, or Cal State schools, but we all still try to keep in touch even if we are far away from one another.
